# Hacker Rank - Warm-up Challenges
**Challenge**: Sock Merchant
**Goal:** Based on an array find the number of pairs

**CONSTRAINTS:**
**1 <= n <=100**
**1 <= ARRAY_SIZE <= 100**

Details of the implementation:
 - Custom array generator has been created. 
 - Used Counter method to get a dictionary of repeated words
 - Divided between 2 all the values of the dictionary to get the results

### Why?
**For example:** if we want to divide 3/2 the result will be 1.5, this means that we have 1 pair and a half.
By doing floor we return 1, this means that for every odd number we always going to follow the same strategy
